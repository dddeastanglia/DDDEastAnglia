                <p>Hello,</p>

                <p>The <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#013c01">DDD East Anglia</span> team would like to thank you for submitting your session. Unfortunately, your session narrowly missed out from being in the list of selected sessions on the agenda. However, as your session only narrowly missed out, we would like to offer you a place on our reserve speaker list.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top:40px">What does this mean?</h4>
                
                <p>Being a reserve speaker means that you will be on standby on the day (in Cambridge on Saturday September 26th, 2015) to give your talk in the event of another speaker being unable to present. You will be expected to have your session ready to go at short notice. In return, we offer guaranteed attendance by pre-registering you for the conference before registration opens.</p>
                
                <p>If you would be interested in being a reserve speaker, please could you let us know by <span style="font-weight:bold">the end of 21st August</span> by replying to this email. If you are planning on travelling to Cambridge on the day, or will need to leave before the end of the day, could you also please let us know.</p>
                
                <h4 style="margin-top:40px">Lunchtime &quot;grok&quot; talks</h4>
                
                <p>A tradition at many DDD events is for attendees to give &quot;grok&quot; talks during the lunch break. These are 5-10 minutes talks, and can be about any subject. If you would like to give a shortened version of your session in the form of a grok talk, or a talk about any other subject, please let us know.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top:40px">Accommodation</h4>

                <p>The recommended hotel for this year's conference will be the <a href="http://www.premierinn.com/en/checkHotel/CAMNEW/cambridge-city-east">Premier Inn</a> on <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/pYTkM">Newmarket Road, Cambridge</a>.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top:40px">Contact information</h4>
